# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Dockstore system routinely receives security updates to the most recently
released tagged minor version. All previous versions are unsupported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the "Report a vulnerability" button to the upper right to report security vulnerabilities. A helpdesk ticket on [discourse](https://discuss.dockstore.org/) may be an option for privacy complaints or other urgent non-security matters. Both options will be addressed by Dockstore administrators.

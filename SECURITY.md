# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Dockstore system routinely receives security updates to the most recently
released tagged minor version. All previous versions are unsupported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go to [Security](https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore/security) to report a vulnerability or if you are already there, use the "Report a vulnerability" button to the upper right to report security vulnerabilities. A helpdesk ticket on [discuss.dockstore.org](https://discuss.dockstore.org/t/opening-helpdesk-tickets/1506) may be an option for privacy complaints or other urgent non-security matters. Both options will be addressed by Dockstore administrators.
